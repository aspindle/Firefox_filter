Firefox Filter but want it to work on [mobile also](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/reference-browser/discussions/2540#discussioncomment-7614646)...

Could be used for Cookies/Covid/Popups/Accessibility/Ads/Suggested/Translate/Follow Buttons & Counts... 

Large scope tho, focused on single the use case of social link removal

Proof of concept, for now...
