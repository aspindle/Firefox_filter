Social Link Removal but want it to work on [mobile also](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/reference-browser/discussions/2540#discussioncomment-7614646)...

Could be used for all Cookies/War/Covid/Popups/Accessibility/Ads/Translate... 

Large scope tho, focused on single use case of social link removal

Proof of concept, for now...
